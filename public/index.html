      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <div><p>A term paper is due tomorrow, worth a large chunk of your grade. Unfortunately, you forgot about it, and have only <strong>10 hours</strong> to complete it. Yikes!</p>

        <p>There are two actions available to you, and each takes exactly one hour. You can either <strong>do research</strong> or <strong>just start writing.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You don’t actually have any ideas yet, so if you just write without any research, each hour of writing only nets you 5 points out of 100 on your final grade, to give you a failing grade of 50. </p> 
        
        <p>But don’t despair, you can do some research as well as write.</p>

        <p>An hour of researching doesn’t get you any credit directly, but helps shape your thinking for when you do start writing: specifically, each hour of research has a 50% chance you find nothing, and a 50% chance that you find something great, which gives you an <strong>additional</strong> 5 points per future hour of writing.</p>

        <p>Try to get the highest score you can!</p>
